In Floating point representation we have three components

1.The Sign Bit
2.Exponent
3.Fractional Part
Precession is one the prime attribute of any Floating point Representation, 

1.Does any of the above three components play a role in the defining the Precession of the number ? If so which are the component or Components  which play the  role in defining precession  and how ? Explain this with example in your own words
2.What is Normal and Subnormal  Values as per IEEE 754  standards  explain this  with the  help of number line
3.IEEE 754vv defines standards for rounding floating points numbers to a represent able value. There are five methods defines by IEEE for this â€“ Take time and  understand what these five methods and explain it in your words using diagrams, illustrations of your own.
