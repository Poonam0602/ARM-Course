The reason why second code runs but first doesn't:

1. There are few restrictions which needs to be followed while using 'IT/ITE'(If Then Else) in ARM assembly codes which 
are mentioned in Section 9.3.3 Restrictions

2. In Cortex-M3/M4F Instruction Set Manual, it is clearly written that ,
"Each instruction inside the IT block must specify a condition code suffix that is either the same or the logical inverse." 
(Section 9.3.3 -> point 7)

3. So, in first code, the condition suffix is not used in the subsequent instructions in IT block whereas it is used in 
code 2. Thus, second code follows the rule and hence, compiles. The first code does not follow the rule and hence, gives 
compilation error.
